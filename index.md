### **About Me**

I am a PhD student at [Department of Statistics](https://science.psu.edu/stat), The Pennsylvania State University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Matthew Reimherr](https://mreimherr.github.io/). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor degree in Statistics from University of Science and Technology of China. 

My research interests are mainly forcing on functional/longitudinal data, statistical transfer learning and differential privacy with kernel methods. Currently, I'm working on accurately and adaptively estimating the discrepancy between different domains in transfer learning and multi-task learning.
