### **About Me**

I am a PhD student in [Department of Statistics](https://science.psu.edu/stat), The Pennsylvania State University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Matthew Reimherr](https://mreimherr.github.io/). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor degree in Statistics from University of Science and Technology of China. 

My research interests are mainly forcing on statistical transfer learning, functional/longitudinal data and differential privacy with kernel methods. Currently, I'm interested in leveraging kernel methods to theoretically address learning problems with different types of distribution shifts.
